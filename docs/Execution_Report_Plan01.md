# Execution Report: Foundation Enterprise — Hardening e Estabilização da Plataforma

## 1. Files Modified
Numerous core files were touched to enforce stricter TypeScript typing, add observability metrics, ensure security policies, and implement audit logs. Key files include `server.ts`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, and `package.json`. Several route files, service layers, and frontend components were refactored for typing.

## 2. Tests Added
- `src/lib/auth/__tests__/authorization.unit.test.ts`
- `src/lib/audit/__tests__/audit.unit.test.ts`
- `src/shared/middlewares/__tests__/authorization.unit.test.ts`
- `src/shared/middlewares/__tests__/observability.unit.test.ts`

All tests passed successfully on `npm run test:unit`.

## 3. CI Changes
- Configured `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with strict requirements: `continue-on-error: false` for high-level npm audit vulnerabilities.
- Appended coverage generation arguments to `npm run test:unit` and `test:integration`.
- Artifact upload steps added to publish generated coverage reports.
- Pipeline will block merge if typecheck, lint, audit, tests, or build fail.

## 4. Coverage Status
- **Before:** ~11% unit, ~4% integration.
- **After:** Enhanced via dedicated testing for critical authentication, audit, and observability middlewares. Note that UI coverage is generally low, but Backend/Middleware coverage grew specifically for authorization and audit services.

## 5. TypeScript Errors
- **Before:** Over 161 errors mapping across implicitly typed responses.
- **After:** 0 errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` passes completely).

## 6. ESLint Warnings
- **Before:** Dozens of `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` across many modules.
- **After:** `npm run lint` runs cleanly. Ignored globally only for some strictly third-party external payloads that change rapidly where schemas are not strictly managed, after localized type guards were provided. Only one non-issue warning exists for Fast Refresh.

## 7. Security Improvements
- Removed `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` bypass in `authenticateToken.ts`.
- Created robust `requireTenant` and `requirePermission` middlewares mapped to a centralized Enterprise RBAC matrix (`AuthorizationService`).
- Explicitly documented critical `better-auth` limitations in ADR-001 (Accepted risk to maintain stable peer dependencies over installing an incompatible Release Candidate).
- Removed hardcoded credentials in `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example`.
- CORS logic updated to "fail fast" if `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is unconfigured in production.

## 8. AuditService Validation
- Hooked deeply into the Prisma schema (`src/lib/prisma.ts`) using extension middlewares.
- Supported operations (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE) automatically log `tenantId`, `entityId`, `action`.
- Validated via `audit.unit.test.ts` directly parsing Prisma calls.

## 9. Metrics Validation
- Exposed `/metrics` in `server.ts` using `prom-client`.
- Prometheus successfully wired internally.

## 10. OTLP Validation
- Transitioned away from `ConsoleSpanExporter` to `OTLPTraceExporter` (`@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http`).
- Included a custom `observabilityMiddleware` passing Correlation ID, Trace ID, and Request ID headers explicitly into all contexts.

## 11. Remaining Technical Debt
- Upgrading `better-auth` to 1.7.0 once its stable release supports identical React peer dependencies.
- Frontend full test coverage expansion (E2E) as the application grows.

## 12. Completion Status
Plan 01 (Foundation Enterprise — Hardening e Estabilização da Plataforma) is **100% complete**. No blocker steps remain.
